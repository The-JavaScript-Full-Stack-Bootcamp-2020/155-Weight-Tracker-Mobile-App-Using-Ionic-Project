The JavaScript Full-Stack Bootcamp: LEVEL 34 BUILDING MOBILE APPS WITH JAVASCRIPT (Lesson 155)

We create a mobile app that tracks your weight (or some other measurement worth storing) in a list of record. All using Ionic.

The app is very simple: it allows measures to be added and deleted from the records.
